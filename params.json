{"name":"iSeriesDbfit","tagline":"DbFit is a database testing framework that supports easy test-driven development of your database code. iSeriesDbFit is tailored for IBM's implementation of DB2 on the iSeries.","body":"### DbFit Enabled for the iSeries.\r\nDbFit is a framework that allows us to blend SQL verifications with our REST response verifications when testing with RestFixture.  We use RestFixture to issue the REST request and verify the XML response with XPATH expressions and very simple SQL queries.  \r\n\r\nDbFit allows for more robust queries that are easier to write and to read.  Using this approach, we focus on the REST response using RestFixture, and we focus on verifying the client database using DbFit.\r\n\r\nThis project was forked from @benilovj.
